        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        
        <p><b>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</b></p>

        <p>My name is Ariana (Ari) Kohl. I am majoring in communication design and I am a senior.</p>
        
        <p><b>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b></p>

        <p>This class is one of the options for requirements for my major, but I chose this course rather than the other options because I am really interested in UX Design so I am curious in understanding the foundations of frontend development for websites.</p>

        <p><b>3. Do you have experience with HTML/CSS?JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b></p>

        <p>No experience!</p>

        <p><b>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b></p>

        <p>I hope to learn the difference in development for different breakpoints, such as desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>

        <p><b>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b></p>

        <p>I expect it to be more fluid and dynamic in nature as screen content is frequently revised and updated even after its published.</p>

        <p><b>6. Provide a link with a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b></p>

        <p>I think the <a href=https://www.airbnb.com/>Airbnb</a> website exemplifies effective design. It is engaging, easy to use, clear in the information being presented. The website also leverages a lot of imagery to capture visual interest.</p>

        <p><b>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b></p>

        <p>I think the <a href=https://www.reddit.com/>Reddit</a> website exemplifies effective communication. It is an open forum, moderated by our peers resulting in a community of more authentic opinions and communication.</p>
        
        <p><b>8. Provide a link with a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b></p>

        <p>I think the <a href=https://www.apple.com/mac/>Apple</a> website as a whole, but most specifically the Mac webpage works really well. It feels premium, reflecting the intended quality of their product. Additionally, it is easily navigable and intuitive for the user in both locating available information as well as purchasing products.</p>
