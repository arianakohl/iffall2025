            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (380g) ripe and mashed banana (3-4 medium bananas), measured</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (100g) packed light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (110g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (130g) 2% Greek yogurt (sour cream also works)</li>
                <li>1 1/3 cups (180g) all-purpose flour or 1-to-1 gluten-free baking flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (140g) mini chocolate chips + a handful more for sprinkling on top</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 325F and grease and line a 9 by 5 loaf pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the melted butter and sugars until you reach a paste-like consistency. This may take some vigorous whisking for a minute or two. You can either use a whisk or an electric mixer with the paddle attachment.</li>
            <li>Add in your mashed bananas followed by the eggs, yogurt, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Once all of your wet ingredients are mixed together, fold in the dry ingredients. Then, fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan and spread it even. Sprinkle extra chocolate chips on top if you like.</li>
            <li>Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs. Let it cool completely before removing from the pan. Store at room temperature in an air-tight container.</li>
            <li>Now dig in!</li>
        </ol>
