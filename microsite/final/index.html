      <h1>What is the<br>Myers–Briggs<br>Type Indicator?</h1>
      <p>The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-report questionnaire that makes pseudoscientific claims to categorize individuals into 16 distinct "personality types" based on psychology. The test assigns a binary letter value to each of four dichotomous categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, and judging or perceiving. This produces a four-letter test result such as "INTJ" or "ESFP", representing one of 16 possible types.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>

  <div class="history-block">
    <h3>Who created the MBTI assessment?</h3>
    <p>
      It began with Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, in the United States in the early mid-20th century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briggs was inspired to research personality type theory when she met Isabel’s future husband, Clarence Myers. She noticed he had a different way of seeing the world. This intrigued her enough to start a literature review to understand different temperaments.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="history-block">
    <h3>What is Jung’s influence on MBTI theory?</h3>
    <p>
      Carl G Jung published <em>Psychological Types</em> in 1921. Briggs read the English translation (1923) and saw similarities between their ideas. However, Jung’s theories of personal difference were much more developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briggs and Myers thought Jung’s work was so useful that they wanted to make his ideas accessible to a wider audience.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="history-block">
    <h3>When was the MBTI assessment first published?</h3>
    <p>
      World War II was a huge influence on the project’s development. Myers believed that if people understood each other better, they’d work together better and there’d be less conflict. The post-war world could be a better place.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was determined to find a way to give people access to their psychological type. This led to the idea of a type indicator, and Myers dedicated the rest of her life to its development.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spent the next 20 years developing questions and validating the instrument and the theory. The MBTI instrument was first published in 1962.
