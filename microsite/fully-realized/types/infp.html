      <p>INFPs are quiet idealists, guided by their core values and beliefs. As Mediators, they are deeply empathetic, imaginative, and driven by a sense of moral purpose and meaning.</p>
      <p>Though they may seem reserved, INFPs possess rich inner lives and a strong desire to understand themselves and others. They are passionate about helping people and often express their values through art, writing, or activism.</p>
      <p>Core cognitive functions include: <strong>Introverted Feeling (Fi)</strong>, <strong>Extraverted Intuition (Ne)</strong>, <strong>Introverted Sensing (Si)</strong>, and <strong>Extraverted Thinking (Te)</strong>.</p>
